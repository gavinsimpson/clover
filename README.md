# Harmonized association data for the vertebrate virome

You're looking for data for your research on wildlife virology, macroecology, or zoonotic risk prediction. But there are too many options! They're all slightly different, and some haven't been updated for years. How do you know which one to use? If everyone is using different data, could that be the reason they have different findings?

## What is üçÄ?

CLOVER is a reconciled aggregate of four popular datasets that catalog host-virus associations: EcoHealth Alliance's [HP3](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/HP3), UGA's [GMPD2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.1799/suppinfo), U. Liverpool's [EID2](https://eid2.liverpool.ac.uk/), and an unnamed dataset curated by [Shaw](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.8262779) _et al._ The four datasets have all been harmonized internally and then against  the internal taxonomy used by NCBI on popular data portals like GenBank. Then, we've merged them to create the best available data source on the host-virus network (and save you the trouble of merging on your own).
