# A reconciled association dataset for the global vertebrate virome

## What is üçÄ?
You're looking for data for your research on wildlife virology, viral macroecology, or zoonotic risk prediction. But there are just too many options!

CLOVER is a reconciled aggregate of four popular datasets that catalog host-virus associations: EcoHealth Alliance's [HP3](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/HP3), UGA's [GMPD2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.1799/suppinfo), U. Liverpool's [EID2](https://eid2.liverpool.ac.uk/), and an unnamed dataset curated by [Shaw](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.8262779) _et al._ The four datasets have all been harmonized internally and then against  the internal taxonomy used by NCBI on popular data portals like GenBank. Then, we've merged them to create the best available data source on the host-virus network (and save you the trouble of merging on your own).
